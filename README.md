In this repository you can find the files generated in the **final evaluation of Module 1 - HTML and CSS** within **[Adalab](https://adalab.es/)'s Web Development Bootcamp - Promo Radia**.

## 📝 Requirements

With a **Zeplin design** as the starter point, the exercise consists on developing a web-site using the following **elements**:

- **Sass**
- **Flexbox and CSS Grid**
- **Media queries**
- **Interactions with the user**

The following **requirements** have to be respected:

1. The **menu** button should have a **fixed position** and should not dissapear when scrolling. It should also contain a link to [Adalab](https://adalab.es/)'s website.
2. The **firs module** (Anonymous proxy) should be solved using **flexbox**, and it needs to occupy the height of the viewport.
3. The **second module** (Looking Through A Window) should be sholved using the **desired CSS properties**.
4. The **third module** (3 Reasons to Purchase) should be laid out using **CSS Grid** in all screen sizes.
5. The **fourth module** should be laid out using **flexbox** and all links should redirect to [Adalab](https://adalab.es/)'s website.

In total, there are several **interactions** to resolve:

1. The **arrow button** in the hero module should **link to the "3 Reasons To Purchase" section**.
2. The **footer arrow** button should link to the **top of the page**.
3. All **footer links** should go to **[Adalab](https://adalab.es/)**.
4. In the **buttons** ("Go" and "3 Reasons To Purchase") you must include a **transform** that we leave to your choice.
5. **BONUS**: 
   - make a small **animation** in the footer button.
   - make the **transform with transition**.

## 🛠️ Tools
The project has been developed with **'Adalab Starter Kit'**, a framework created in node and gulp that has pre-installed and pre-configured functionalities. It also contains an **HTML template engine**, a **Sass preprocessor** and a local server, among other elements.

The following tools have been used when solving the project:

- **HTML** (with partials for an easier lecture and project organization)
- **CSS/Sass**
- **Partials**
- **Variables, mixins and functions**
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**
- **Box model** (size, padding and margin)
- **Media queries**
- **Position**
- **Transition**
- **Animation**
- **GIT version control**

## 💾 Steps to follow to use this project on your computer:

> **NOTE:** This project has been carried out using **Adalab Starter Kit**.

**First** of all, in order to have the repository on your computer:

1. Click on the top right corner > **Fork**.
2. It will ask you to choose which GitHub user you want to fork it to. **Choose your user**.
3. **Go to github.com/your-user/name-of-project**, **clone it** and do whatever you want, you can rename the repo, change the code, redeploy it to GitHub Pages...
4. **Finally** and for everything to work properly, **you must disable GitHub Pages and re-enable** it so that GitHub generates the new URL correctly.

Once you have **done the fork**:

1. Open it in your code editor.
2. Open a terminal and **install the local dependencies** by executing in the command terminal. Here are the ones I used to start my project:

```bash
npm install
```

The project has to be **started** every time we start programming, to do this we will execute the **command**:

```bash
npm start
```
After running `npm start` we can start editing all the files inside the src/ folder and program comfortably 💫
